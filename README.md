# lambda-dev-server
A lightweight development server for AWS Lambda, lambda-dev-server emulates the Lambda environment locally by creating events and contexts for any app handler. It processes requests, generates Lambda events, and returns parsed responsesâ€”ideal for development and debugging, with hot-reloading for rapid iteration. Not intended for production use.
